# Professional README Generator

## Description

For this challenge/assignment I was tasked with a command line application that automatically generates a professional README markdown file for a repo based on answers from the user. When the  application runs, it presents questions/prompts so that the user can fill in the section in the README. When all prompts are answered the README file  will generate the users answers and save it in the dist folder of the repo.
